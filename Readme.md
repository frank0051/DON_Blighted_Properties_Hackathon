## <a name="why"></a>Why does this matter?

City Councilmembers and citizens regularly ask for information about blighted properties and nuisances. To do so, they have to contact City staff and even what on public records request. Using City of Houston Blighted Properties, we wanted to allow cities and Councilmembers and more proactive way to see what's going on in their neighborhood.
